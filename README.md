# Toward a robust and simple guideline for checking the Central Limit Theorem
  In statistical practice, many introductory statistical procedures require
  the sampling distribution
  of means to be approximately normal. Most students learn a simplified check
  of this condition as "n >= 30", which often becomes a black-and-white mantra
  replacing visual inspection of the data. A slightly more detailed version
  might be "n >= 30 as long as the population distribution is not too skewed."
  Our research seeks to clarify a guideline that incorporates measures of skewness
  along with sample size. We used simulation to explore the consequences of
  skewed populations with different sample sizes. We hope to provide students and
  practitioners with a slightly more refined rule that allows a way to operationalize
  the degree of skewness in statistical analysis.
